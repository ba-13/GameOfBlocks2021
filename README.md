## Pre-req Assignment: BlackJack

Implemented in Python, with no possible way to 'hide' data in classes, as Python doesn't have private variables or methods.

---

## Assignment 1: Making Nounce less than the target

Implemented with Node, User has to input a string, whose hash is displayed, and the program tries to concatenate a number, trying each time to get the nounce, the digest, less than the target value, which is `0x00000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`.  
More info [here](./Assignment1/README.md).

## Assignment 2: Making a basic Special Contract

Implemented with Solidity, User has to, preferably, either use [Remix IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org) or Truffle with npm.  
Two contracts implemented are `MetaCoins` and `Loans` with basic features implemented to simulate a special contract, run on a JavaScript Virtual Machine.  
More info [here](./Assignment2/README.md).
