> Pre-req Assignment: BlackJack.

Implemented in Python, with no possible way to 'hide' data in classes, as Python doesn't have private variables or methods.

> Assignment 1: Making Nounce less than the target.

Implemented with Node, User has to input a string, whose hash is displayed, and the program tries to concatenate a number, trying each time to get the nounce, the digest, less than the target value, which is `0x00000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`.<br/>More info `./Assignment1/README.md`.

Implemented with Solidity, User has to, preferably, either use <a href="http://remix.ethereum.org">Remix IDE</a> or Truffle with npm. <br />
Two contracts implemented are `MetaCoins` and `Loans` with basic features implemented to simulate a special contract, run on a JavaScript Virtual Machine.<br/>More info `./Assignment2/README.md`.
